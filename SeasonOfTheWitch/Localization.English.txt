UIIntroText2.uitext,"Nola Mason - a bright young mathematics student attending Miskatonic University - is one of the many residents of the Witch House. Frank Elwood, anohter tenant, recently reported Nola had gone missing. Your case started there. Frank informed you that Nola had only moved into the low rent Witch House to explore a theory - she believed that Riemannian equations could bend time and space, opening gates to other places and dimensions, and something about the architecture of the Witch House intrigued her. Frank described how, over time, Nola became obsessed, secluding herself in different rooms to study the intricate angles of the house, and how she would ramble on about how she could finally prove her theory.\n\nBut then she started to make other wild claims, like how she spoke to old Keziah at night. She even claimed to see the witch's rat-like familiar, ""Brown Jenkins,"" who was the source of many urban legends concerning the Witch House.\n\nIt was with geniune fear that Frank begged you to find the missing girl before midnight strikes on the convenient occasion of Walpurgis Eve."

UIIntroText1.uitext,The frightened student's story was typical of the superstitious nature of most Arkham natives. Even the highly educated professors at Miskatonic University seemed to believe the place was cursed, haunted, or worse. The decaying eyesore was built in the late 1600s by Keziah Mason, a woman sentenced to death in Salem for allegedly practicing witchcraft. However, she mysteriously escaped the gallows and was never seen again. Her ancestral estate is now cleverly referred to as the Witch House, and legends circle around its gabled buttresses like flies on a corpse.\n\nIf only young Nola Mason's disappearance was such a legend.

Darkness has fallen on Arkham and, like the locals, your mind begins to play tricks on you as you approach the ancient building. Fortunately, the residents of the Witch House have fled in fear of Walpurgis, leaving the house free for you to investigate.</i>
