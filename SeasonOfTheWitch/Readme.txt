Season of the Witch 
Adapted for Mansions of Madness Second Edition
----------------------------------------------------------
Original story: Richard Launius and Fantasy Flight Games
Conversion: Ironmonk

Notes
----------------------------------------------------------
I've tried to be faithful to the original work, but have used substitutions where necessary to
allow this scenario to be played using components available to MoM 2nd Ed players, along with
using mechanics available within Valkyrie.

Substitutions
----------------------------------------------------------
 - Arcane Manuscript will be used as substitution for Witch-Cult in Western Europe.
 - Old Journal will be used as a substitution for Nola's Journal.
 - Grotesque stone will be used as a substitution for Alien Statue.
 - Ritual Components will be used as a substitution for Black Book.
	 - Interacting with the Ritual Components will allow test for destruction of the book.
